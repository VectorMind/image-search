# Overview
Exploring image search techniques using transformer models.

# Demo
The demo was made with `streamlit`
![drop similarity](./images-similarity-clip-vit.gif)

# Test
Models :
* CLIP : `openai/clip-vit-base-patch32`
* ViT : `google/vit-base-patch16-224`

## Test images
The test images are available here

- https://github.com/HomeSmartMesh/website/tree/main/public/images

Two images have been cropped and the cropped images have been input for search in the full images dataset

## Concepts
* Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR)
* Image Recognition
* Feature Extraction
* Semantic Search using trnasformers
## Tools and libraries
* OpenCV
* Scikit-Image
* Pillow/PIL
* TensorFlow and PyTorch
* Elasticsearch and other search engines like typesense

## Image similarities

## Image based transformers
* CLIP : Contrastive Languageâ€“Image Pre-training

# Setup
transformers require PyTorch to be installed
* https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

```cmd
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
```
